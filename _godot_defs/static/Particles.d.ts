 * 3D particle node used to create a variety of particle systems and effects. [Particles] features an emitter that generates some number of particles at a given rate.
 *
 * Use the `process_material` property to add a [ParticlesMaterial] to configure particle appearance and behavior. Alternatively, you can add a [ShaderMaterial] which will be applied to all particles.
 *
 * **Note:** [Particles] only work when using the GLES3 renderer. If using the GLES2 renderer, use [CPUParticles] instead. You can convert [Particles] to [CPUParticles] by selecting the node, clicking the **Particles** menu at the top of the 3D editor viewport then choosing **Convert to CPUParticles**.
 *
 * **Note:** After working on a Particles node, remember to update its [member visibility_aabb] by selecting it, clicking the **Particles** menu at the top of the 3D editor viewport then choose **Generate Visibility AABB**. Otherwise, particles may suddenly disappear depending on the camera position and angle.
