/**
 * **Root motion** refers to an animation technique where a mesh's skeleton is used to give impulse to a character. When working with 3D animations, a popular technique is for animators to use the root skeleton bone to give motion to the rest of the skeleton. This allows animating characters in a way where steps actually match the floor below. It also allows precise interaction with objects during cinematics. See also [AnimationTree].
 *
 * **Note:** [RootMotionView] is only visible in the editor. It will be hidden automatically in the running project, and will also be converted to a plain [Node] in the running project. This means a script attached to a [RootMotionView] node **must** have `extends Node` instead of `extends RootMotionView`. Additionally, it must not be a `@tool` script.
