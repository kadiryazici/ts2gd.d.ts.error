 * Initializes the random number generator state based on the given seed value. A given seed will give a reproducible sequence of pseudo-random numbers.

 * **Note:** The RNG does not have an avalanche effect, and can output similar random streams given similar seeds. Consider using a hash function to improve your seed quality if they're sourced externally.
 *
 * **Note:** Setting this property produces a side effect of changing the internal [member state], so make sure to initialize the seed **before** modifying the [member state]:
 *
 * @example 
 * 
 * var rng = RandomNumberGenerator.new()
 * rng.seed = hash("Godot")
 * rng.state = 100 # Restore to some previously saved state.

 * **Warning:** the getter of this property returns the previous [member state], and not the initial seed value, which is going to be fixed in Godot 4.0.

 * var rng = RandomNumberGenerator.new()

 * **Note:** Do not set state to arbitrary values, since the random number generator requires the state to have certain qualities to behave properly. It should only be set to values that came from the state property itself. To initialize the random number generator with arbitrary input, use [member seed] instead.
