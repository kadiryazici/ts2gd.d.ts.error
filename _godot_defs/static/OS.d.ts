 *
 * This method has slightly different behavior based on whether the `blocking` mode is enabled.
 *
 * If `blocking` is `true`, the Godot thread will pause its execution while waiting for the process to terminate. The shell output of the process will be written to the `output` array as a single string. When the process terminates, the Godot thread will resume execution.
 *
 * If `blocking` is `false`, the Godot thread will continue while the new process runs. It is not possible to retrieve the shell output in non-blocking mode, so `output` will be empty.
 *
 * The return value also depends on the blocking mode. When blocking, the method will return an exit code of the process. When non-blocking, the method returns a process ID, which you can use to monitor the process (and potentially terminate it with [method kill]). If the process forking (non-blocking) or opening (blocking) fails, the method will return `-1` or another exit code.
 *
 * Example of blocking mode and retrieving the shell output:
 *
 * @example 
 * 
 * var output = []
 * var exit_code = OS.execute("ls", ["-l", "/tmp"], true, output)
 * @summary 
 *

 * @example 
 * 
 * var pid = OS.execute(OS.get_executable_path(), [], false)
