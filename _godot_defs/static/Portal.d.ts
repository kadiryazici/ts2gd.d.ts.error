 * [Portal]s are a special type of [MeshInstance] that allow the portal culling system to 'see' from one room to the next. They often correspond to doors and windows in level geometry. By only allowing [Camera]s to see through portals, this allows the system to cull out all the objects in rooms that cannot be seen through portals. This is a form of **occlusion culling**, and can greatly increase performance.
 *
 * There are some limitations to the form of portals:
 *
 * They must be single sided convex polygons, and usually you would orientate their front faces **outward** from the [Room] they are placed in. The vertices should be positioned on a single plane (although their positioning does not have to be perfect).
 *
 * There is no need to place an opposite portal in an adjacent room, links are made two-way automatically.
