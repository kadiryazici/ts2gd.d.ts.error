 * The [Portal] culling system requires levels to be built using objects grouped together by location in areas called [Room]s. In many cases these will correspond to actual rooms in buildings, but not necessarily (a canyon area may be treated as a room).
 *
 * Any [VisualInstance] that is a child or grandchild of a [Room] will be assigned to that room, if the `portal_mode` of that [VisualInstance] is set to `STATIC` (does not move) or `DYNAMIC` (moves only within the room).
 *
 * Internally the room boundary must form a **convex hull**, and by default this is determined automatically by the geometry of the objects you place within the room.
 *
 * You can alternatively precisely specify a **manual bound**. If you place a [MeshInstance] with a name prefixed by `Bound_`, it will turn off the bound generation from geometry, and instead use the vertices of this MeshInstance to directly calculate a convex hull during the conversion stage (see [RoomManager]).
 *
 * In order to see from one room into an adjacent room, [Portal]s must be placed over non-occluded openings between rooms. These will often be placed over doors and windows.
