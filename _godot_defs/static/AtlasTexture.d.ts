/**
 * [Texture] resource that crops out one part of the [member atlas] texture, defined by [member region]. The main use case is cropping out textures from a texture atlas, which is a big texture file that packs multiple smaller textures. Consists of a [Texture] for the [member atlas], a [member region] that defines the area of [member atlas] to use, and a [member margin] that defines the border width.
 *
 * [AtlasTexture] cannot be used in an [AnimatedTexture], cannot be tiled in nodes such as [TextureRect], and does not work properly if used inside of other [AtlasTexture] resources. Multiple [AtlasTexture] resources can be used to crop multiple textures from the atlas. Using a texture atlas helps to optimize video memory costs and render calls compared to using multiple small files.
 *
 * **Note:** AtlasTextures don't support repetition. The [constant Texture.FLAG_REPEAT] and [constant Texture.FLAG_MIRRORED_REPEAT] flags are ignored when using an AtlasTexture.
