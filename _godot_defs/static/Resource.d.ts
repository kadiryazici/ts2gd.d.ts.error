Resources can be saved externally on disk or bundled into another object, such as a [Node] or another resource.
 *
 * **Note:** In C#, resources will not be freed instantly after they are no longer in use. Instead, garbage collection will run periodically and will free resources that are no longer in use. This means that unused resources will linger on for a while before being removed.
