 * **Note:** You will only benefit from high radiance sizes if you have perfectly sharp reflective surfaces in your project and are not using [ReflectionProbe]s or [GIProbe]s. For most projects, keeping [member radiance_size] to the default value is the best compromise between visuals and performance. Be careful when using high radiance size values as these can cause crashes on low-end GPUs.
