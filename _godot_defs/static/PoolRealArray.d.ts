 * An [Array] specifically designed to hold floating-point values. Optimized for memory usage, does not fragment the memory.

 *
 * **Note:** Unlike primitive [float]s which are 64-bit, numbers stored in [PoolRealArray] are 32-bit floats. This means values stored in [PoolRealArray] have lower precision compared to primitive [float]s. If you need to store 64-bit floats in an array, use a generic [Array] with [float] elements as these will still be 64-bit. However, using a generic [Array] to store [float]s will use roughly 6 times more memory compared to a [PoolRealArray].
