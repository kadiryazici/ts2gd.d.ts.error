 * Kinematic bodies are special types of bodies that are meant to be user-controlled. They are not affected by physics at all; to other types of bodies, such as a character or a rigid body, these are the same as a static body. However, they have two main uses:
 *
 * **Simulated motion:** When these bodies are moved manually, either from code or from an [AnimationPlayer] (with [member AnimationPlayer.playback_process_mode] set to "physics"), the physics will automatically compute an estimate of their linear and angular velocity. This makes them very useful for moving platforms or other AnimationPlayer-controlled objects (like a door, a bridge that opens, etc).
 *
 * **Kinematic characters:** KinematicBody also has an API for moving objects (the [method move_and_collide] and [method move_and_slide] methods) while performing collision tests. This makes them really useful to implement characters that collide against a world, but don't require advanced physics.

/**
 * Moves the body along a vector. If the body collides with another, it will slide along the other body rather than stop immediately. If the other body is a [KinematicBody] or [RigidBody], it will also be affected by the motion of the other body. You can use this to make moving and rotating platforms, or to make nodes push other nodes.
 *
 * This method should be used in [method Node._physics_process] (or in a method called by [method Node._physics_process]), as it uses the physics step's `delta` value automatically in calculations. Otherwise, the simulation will run at an incorrect speed.
 *
 * `linear_velocity` is the velocity vector (typically meters per second). Unlike in [method move_and_collide], you should **not** multiply it by `delta` â€” the physics engine handles applying the velocity.
 *
 * `up_direction` is the up direction, used to determine what is a wall and what is a floor or a ceiling. If set to the default value of `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`, everything is considered a wall.
 *
 * If `stop_on_slope` is `true`, body will not slide on slopes when you include gravity in `linear_velocity` and the body is standing still.
 *
 * If the body collides, it will change direction a maximum of `max_slides` times before it stops.
 *
 * `floor_max_angle` is the maximum angle (in radians) where a slope is still considered a floor (or a ceiling), rather than a wall. The default value equals 45 degrees.
 *
 * If `infinite_inertia` is `true`, body will be able to push [RigidBody] nodes, but it won't also detect any collisions with them. If `false`, it will interact with [RigidBody] nodes like with [StaticBody].
 *
 * Returns the `linear_velocity` vector, rotated and/or scaled if a slide collision occurred. To get detailed information about collisions that occurred, use [method get_slide_collision].
 *
 * When the body touches a moving platform, the platform's velocity is automatically added to the body motion. If a collision occurs due to the platform's motion, it will always be first in the slide collisions.
